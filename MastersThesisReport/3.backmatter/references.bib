@article{Viola:01,
  abstract = {This paper describes a machine learning approach for visual object
	detection which is capable of processing images extremely rapidly
	and achieving high detection rates. This work is distinguished by
	three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image
	representation called the "integral image" which allows the features
	used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a
	learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number
	of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely
	efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining
	increasingly more complex classifiers in a "cascade" which allows
	background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending
	more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can
	be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which
	unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded
	regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain
	of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to
	the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector
	runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing
	or skin color detection.},
